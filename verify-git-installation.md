# Verify Git installation

Impressions: 3/5

Note:

 - Maybe, adding explanation of how to open a console would help newbies to not lost.
 - Missing smooth transition at the end of the chapter

Jessie and I expect you to be in the folder where the `tennis-ball.txt` file lives. Then, you need to open a console inside this folder and verify that Git was installed correctly.

Let's run our first git command, which will show you the currently installed version of Git.

```
git --version
```

If Git was installed correctly, the following message should be shown in your console.

```
git version X.YY.Z
```

NOTE: Where X.YY.Z is a version like 2.37.0 or whatever version you installed

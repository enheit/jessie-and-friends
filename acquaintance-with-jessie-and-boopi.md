# Acquaintance with Jessie and Boopi

Impression: 4.5/5

Notes:

---

In the everyday world, pets are an integral part of our lives. They help us cope with difficulties and support us in difficult situations as much as they can. When we are sad, they are sad with us, when we are happy, they are happy too. This unspoken love can never disappear between us.

Woof-woof!

Wait Jesse, I'm making a nice introduction for our reader. You don't want to ruin their first impression, do you?

Okay-okay! I remember...

Woof-woof!

I apologize for being distracted, apparently she will not let me finish the introduction

What happened again? Woof! You lost a tennis ball? Another? This is the second ball this week... Alright!

Yes, I'm sorry, I should have introduced you to each other

As you could notice this is Jessie. Jessie, say hi to our reader.

Jessie is a virtual dog who loves running, jumping and having fun in between other doggy activities. Usually, she spends her time playing with Boopi. 

Boopi is a robot that can make any item we want. 

Woof-woof!

Jessie don't interrupt me... I know that Boopi can craft you another tennis ball, but it's time you learn to appreciate things we give you...

The two previous tennis balls we made for Jessie together with Boopi. May I ask you, reader, to help us to create a third one? This is not hard, but I hope that the gift you make she will appreciate much more than the previous two.

I hope I can count on you

I see that Jessie has started to like you, so letâ€™s begin and try to recreate a lost tennis ball.

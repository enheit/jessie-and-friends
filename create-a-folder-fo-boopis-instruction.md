Yes, it took some time to get Git ready for use on our computer. But it can not but rejoice that this process needs to be done only once. 

Woof-woof! Good point, Jessie!

Let's start writing instructions for Boopi. 

First off, we need to find a place where we would store our files with instructions. It is a good practice to group related files under a folder somewhere on your computer. So let's create it. Jessie and I have no claim in which place the folder should be created. The only advice is that the place should be convenient for you. 

Woof! Woof!

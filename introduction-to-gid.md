# Introduction to Git

Impression: 4.5/5

Note:
 - Remove sentences where I promised that we will go through all flows together. It would be much better to say that those flows exist but we will not cover tham.

So, what is a Git? 

> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

This Wikipedia description is overloaded with technical terms and fancy programming words that are not easy for beginners to understand. So, let's split this sentence into logical blocks and understand all of this.

> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files

It means that Git is a program that can be installed on your computer and helps you monitor files and changes that happen inside those files. In our case, these files will be instructions we will upload to Boopi. Don't be scared. These instructions will be easy to understand and fun to write. Let's check the next part.

> …usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development

Typically, many people are involved in the process of developing the program. Each of them is focused on the small part of the large system and develops it locally on their computers. When their piece is ready, developers share it with other collaborators and ask them to review if the work has been done correctly. At this point, all collaborators decide if this part of the code should be added to the main program. If everything is okay, it becomes a part of the large system.

Without Git, the process of adding things and sharing them among other developers could be challenging because some files could be accidentally lost or overwritten by others.

Don't be afraid. We will go through all these flows together, and Git will help us not to lose information.

Woof-Woof!

Yes, Jessie? Woof! Woof-woof! Ah, I see. You want to play with a tennis ball already, but our reader is just taking the first steps, so be patient.

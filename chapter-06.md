# Chapter 6: The first instruction for Boopi

![Boopi is reading instruction](./images/chapter-6.jpeg)

So, it looks like we are inside the newly created folder. Could you explain to us, Jessie, what do we need to do next?

Woof!

Okay, I think I understand! Did you understand the reader? She said that we need to create a file and call it `tennis-ball.txt`. As you may remember, Jessie wants us to create a tennis ball. Since she lost the previous

What next?

Woof-woof!

As Jessie said, we need to open this file and start writing instructions that Boopi can understand. But what kind of instructions can Boopi understand?

Boopi understands the simple steps of how to create objects. By reading line by line, Boopi will be able to create things at the end and pass them to us. So, let’s write instructions for creating a tennis ball.

```
Open the file and write the following instructions.
Step 1. Create a rubber ball with a diameter of 6.54 cm
Step 2. Color it green
Step 3. Add curved white lines
Step 4. Craft
```

Great. Now save the file and close it. Let’s see what happens.

Hm… Nothing happens. Have we missed something?

Woof-woof!

Ah, exactly! How could I forget?

We just created a file inside our folder and named it `tennis-ball.txt`. After, we added instructions inside this file and saved them. But this file is just a file on your computer and does not differ in any way from other files on your computer.

Do you remember that Boopi can load instructions only by using Git? It seems like we didn’t add Git to our folder. But should we? Yes. As we said earlier, Git is a program that can track files and changes inside those files.

Currently, we have Git installed on our computer, but we didn’t ask Git to track files in our folder. By default, installed Git does nothing on a computer until you explicitly ask him to do it.

To ask Git to start working with our files, we need to initialize him in our folder. By “initialize” I mean we must say, “Hey Git, could you take care of this folder?”

So, let’s do this in the next chapter

Hey, this is Jessie. Jessie, say hi to our reader.

Jessie is a virtual dog who loves running, jumping and having fun in between other doggy activities. Under other doggy activities, I mean playing with her friends and Boopi, with whom they love to gift toys to their mutual friends. 

Woof-woof! Yes, Jessie? Woof-woof! Woof! Oh, you lost your tennis ball? I see. Let me think about how we can find it. Woof-woof! Ah, how could I forget? We have a Boopi. 

Boopi is a robot that can make any item we want. Instead of finding the previous tennis ball, we can ask Boopi to create a new one. But how can we do this? As far as I remember, we need to provide some instructions to him. Do you remember how we can do this, Jessie? Woof! Woof! Jessie said that the only option to give instructions to Boopi is to upload them via Git. I already promised Jessie that we would create a new tennis ball for her, but first of all, we need to understand what Git is because there is no other way to give instructions to Boopi. I hope Jesse and I can count on you, reader?

I see that Jessie has started to like you, so letâ€™s begin and try to recreate a lost tennis ball.

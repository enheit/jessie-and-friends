# Create toys for Jessieâ€™s friends in different branches

Impressions: 5/5

Note:

- Would be nice to provide a reader with a result of each executed command (where it needed).

Jessie's friends

Woof-woof! Yes, Jessie? Oh, who is it? Woof-woof-woof! Ah, it's your friends? Woof. Hi friends, it's me, reader and Boopi; nice to meet you. 
Woof-woof! Ah, Jessie said that her friends saw her playing with a tennis ball and wanted toys to play with them too. What a great idea. It would be nice to make some more toys for friends, what do you think, reader and Boopi? Alright

Let's create a rubber bone and flying disc for them. But before we start creating instruction files, let's think about how we could do this. The easiest way would be to create two separate files for each toy, then provide instructions and commit two files together. Usually, putting different things inside a single commit is not a good practice. You can think of a commit as one atomic change. It makes our Git history clear and our commits independent of each other. So, if we start to follow these recommendations, we would create two different files and put each of those files into a separate commit. Much better. Each commit will contain unique atomic changes that can be easily read and created by Boopi. 

But let's think if we had more than two files. Suppose Jessie comes not with two of her friends but a hundred. We would need to create a hundred files and make each commit for them. It would create a mess in our folder. It would be painful to navigate between tons of untracked files and jump between them if needed. As you may have noticed, I'm taking you to a new feature in Git called branches.

So, what branches are? You can think of branches like a separate "universe" in your folder. You can create "universes", jump between them and remove them if you want. Each of those "universes" has different folders, files, and commits. It sounds a lot more complicated than it really is. So, let's create our first "universe" a.k.a branch.

I expect your console to be open inside your folder and wait for new commands to execute.

To create a new branch, we need to use `git branch` command with the name.

```
git branch rubber-bone
```

After running this command, Git must create a new branch in your folder. You may notice that no messages appeared in the console. It's correct. We have just created a branch named `rubber-bone`. To confirm that we can run another command

```
git branch --list
```

It should list all existing branches in your project. 

```
master
rubber-bone
```

You may wonder why `git branch --list` returned two branches instead of one? Good question. The `master` (or `main`, `thunk`) is the standard branch that is created along with the initialization of the project. Remember we started our project with `git init` command? At that moment, Git created a default branch called `master`. Moreover, when we created the tennis ball and made a commit, that commit was added to the `master` branch. I didn't mention it earlier because it wasn't necessary to know. Now, when we created a new branch, we are still on the `master` branch. We can verify it by running this command

```
git branch --show-current
```

It should print `master`. By default, when you create a branch, Git does not automatically switch to it. Instead, it creates it in the background and lets you switch to it later.

To switch to a newly created branch, we need to run one more command and provide the name of the desired branch. In our case, it should be `rubber-bone`

```
git checkout rubber-bone
```

After running this command you may notice a message in a console

```
Switched to branch 'rubber-bone'
```

It means that we have successfully switched to a new branch. Let's verify it by running an already known command.

```
git branch --show-current
```

If we did everything correctly, this should show the `rubber-bone` name in the console.

After creating a new branch and switching to it, we can finally create a file and provide instructions inside it.

Let's create a file called `rubber-bone.txt`

Open the file and write the following.

```
Step 1. Create a rubber
Step 2. Shape into a bone
Step 3. Color is red
```

Save the file and close it

Good. Now we have a new untracked file. Let's make a commit

As you remember, before making a commit, we need to specify what files will be included inside the commit. To do this, we will use the already known command `git add`

```
git add rubber-bone.txt
```

After running `git status` we can verify that our `rubber-bone.txt` has been added to the staged area. 

The final step that we need to do is to create a commit

Previously, when we created a commit for `tennis-ball.txt`, we used `git commit` command without attributes. It opened the editor where we could specify the commit message. There is a shorter way to provide a commit message without opening any text editor. Let's see how we can achieve this.

```
git commit -m "Add file with instructions of how to create a rubber bone"
```

As you can see, we have added the `-m` attribute with our commit name enclosed in double-quotes.

Okay, we created a file with instructions and made a commit. Why doesn't Boopi create an item?

Remember that I said that creating a new branch creates a new "universe" where our files and folders will live? That is exactly what happened. Boopi remained in the previous branch `master`, but we are on the `rubber-bone` branch now. It means that Boopi doesn't have access to the files and folders that were created on the different branch. How we can pass this files, or in our case, a file to the Boopi?

Good question. 

To move the file to the `master` branch, we need to merge two branches into one. In other words, you can think of it as merging two universes. Everything that exists in one universe will collide with another universe. But instead of creating a new universe, it continues to exist in one of those universes. How can we decide what universe will preserve changes of both? It depends on what universe we are pouring changes into. It may sound complicated, but in reality, it is nothing more than just saying, "You must merge into me."

Let's do this.

Before merging our "universes" let's verify that our commit exists by running `git log` command in our `rubber-bone` branch.

_provide an example of result message after running `git log` command which shows two commits_

Hah. Have you noticed that `git log` printed two commits instead of one? It printed `Add tennis-ball.txt` as well as our commit with a rubber bone. But how is it possible? We are on the `rubber-bone` branch, and can still see commits from another "universe"? Yes.

I didn't mention this before because it would make it harder to describe the branches. But in general, there is nothing special. Whenever you create a new branch in your project, the newly created branch will be based on the current state of the active branch. It means that on the moment when we used a `git branch rubber-bone` Git created a new branch with all commits of the `master` branch and "put it" into a newly created branch (`rubber-bone`). Therefore, when you run the `git log` command, you see the commits from the current branch and previous commits of the branch that you were based on. If we could visualize this, it would look like the following picture.

I hope it makes sense to you now. 

So far, we created a single commit on the `rubber-bone` branch with a instructions on how to create a rubber bone toy. But it doesn't help Jessie's friends to start to play with toys yet. Let's take a few more steps in this direction and create a missing flying disc.

At this moment, we have an unmerged branch with a rubber bone toy, we need to create another branch and create a flying disc there.

Let's do this but with fewer explanations.

Let's switch back to the master branch (without merging).

```
git checkout master
```

Run `git log` and verify that the commit from the `rubber-bone` branch didn't leak to the `master` branch.

Good. The `git log` command should show the only commit with a tennis ball.

Let's create a new branch called `flying-disk` based on the `master`

```
git branch flying-disc
```

And switch to the branch

```
git checkout flying-disc
```

Let's verify that we're on the new branch

```
git branch --show-active
```

It should print the `flying-disc` 

If we run the `git log`, it also should show the commit with the tennis ball because, as I said earlier, newly created branches are always based on the state of the currently active branch. In our case, we based on the `master` branch where commit with a tennis ball was already created.

Let's create a new file called `flying-disc.txt` and add instructions inside it.

Open the file and provide the following instructions.

```
Step 1. Create a circular object
Step 2. Make it thin
Step 3. Color it blue
```

Save changes and close the file.

Let's make a commit with this file

```
git add flying-disc.txt
git commit -m "Add a file with instructions on how to create a rubber bone." 
```

Good. We just created another commit of the instructions for the flying disc. Let's verify that commit was added to the history by running `git log` command.


```
git log
```

Hold on. It shows the incorrect message, "Add a file with instructions on how to create a rubber bone.", but we provided instructions on creating a flying disc.

What can we do? Is there any command that can help us to modify existing commits? Of course, there is.

Git provides us a possibility to amend existing commits. If we accidentally committed a wrong file, or we forget to add something to the commit, or we made a mistake in the name of the commit, all of these problems Git allows us to fix.

There are many approaches to modifying the existing commit, but we will use one of them.

Inside your console, write the following.

```
git commit --amend
```

It must open the text editor with the commit message of the latest commit.

It is exactly what we needed. Our latest commit on the `flying-disc` branch contains the commit with the wrong title description.

In the opened text editor, let's change the commit message to "Add instructions on how to create a flying disc". All what we need to do is to replace _ruber bone_ with a _flying disc_.

Save the file and close it.

If we have done everything correctly, Git should replace the old wrong commit message with a new one.

We can verify it by running `git log -1`

```
git log -1
```

Yes, our commit message has the correct description.

Good job. We just fixed an incorrect commit message and finally can merge our instructions from both branches into the master.

You must remember that merging is colliding two "universes". To collide `master` branch with two other branches, we need to go back to the `master` branch and specify what branch we want to "collide into us".

Let's back to the `master` branch

```
git checkout master
```

The final step is to ask Git to merge (collide) another branch into the current. We can achieve this by running the next command.

```
git merge rubber-bone
```

It may automatically open an editor and ask you provide a short description of what is happening. Usually, it comes with a predefined message like "Merge 'rubber-bone' into 'master'". We can leave it as is and close the editor.

Nice. Look at Boopi. It crafts a rubber bone! Good job, reader!

Let's see what happened with our commit history.

```
git log
```

The latest commit is the technical one. It holds the information about what happened. In our case, it shows that Git merged two branches. The commit before the techical one contains the instructions on how to create a `rubber bone`. That is, a commit with a `rubber-bone.txt` file.

You can open a folder and verify that the `rubber-bone.txt` file has been added to the folder. 

Nice! We successfully merged our first branch!

Woof-woof! Yes, Jessie? Woof-woof! Ah, how could we forget? We didn't merge the toy for the another Jessie's friend -- flying disc! Let's do the same steps that we did with `rubber-bone` branch.

To merge the remaining branch, we can run the following command

```
git merge flying-disc
```

If should again open a text editor with the default commit message for the merge commit (or as we called it earlier a techincal commit). We can ignore it. Save and close the editor.

Look at Boopi! It creates a flying disc! 

Woof-woof!

Nice! We merged another branch into our `master`. Now our history of the `master` branch should consist of commits from two other branches.

Since everyone received the toys and was happy, we can do the last but not the least thing - remove unused branches.

Usually, branches have a limited lifetime. They make sense only during the development process. Once you've finished working on a branch (as we did) and merged it into another branch, it rarely remains useful the rest of the time. It is a good practice to remove them. 

To not guess what branch was already merged into the current active branch we can use another useful Git command

```
git branch --merged
```

It should show the list of all branches that were already merged into the current one. 

> NOTE: It includes the currently active branch (it is marked with an asterisk `*`). Don't delete it by accident.

After reviewing the list of merged branches, we can remove them.

```
git branch -d rubber-bone
```

It should remove the `rubber-bone` branch, and

```
git branch -d flying-disc
```

It should remove the `flying-disc` branch.

Good job. Now we don't have "zombie" branches on our computer. We can verify it by running

```
git branch --list
```

As you can see, it again shows only the `master` branch.

Woof-woof! Yes, Jessie, I see! You are all happy to play with your toys! Say thanks to the reader and Boopi without them this would not be possible! You can keep having fun with newly created toys, but we need to keep learning Git! Let's move on to the next challenge!

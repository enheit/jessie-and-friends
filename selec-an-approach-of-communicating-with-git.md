Select an approach of communicating with Git

Before initializing Git, we need to understand how we will use Git in the future.

There are two approaches to how you can interact with Git:

* Git GUI
* Git CLI

Git GUI stands for Graphical User Interface, meaning you will interact with Git by using the program interface with buttons, tabs, and other UI elements. The typical GUI looks like this.

Git CLI stands for Command Line Interface, meaning you will interact with Git using a console on your computer (PowerShell, Bash, or Terminal).

We will use a Git CLI (that is, console) because it will give you more understanding of what is going on under the hood of Git. You will learn the basic commands that we will paste into the console to manage and control the Git state. In the future, you can use whichever approach you want. But for educational purposes, we would stop at the classic one.

So let's intialize git inside our folder using a console

# Chapter 4: Verify Git installation

Woof-woof!

Oh, you’re already here. Well done! It means that you installed Git on your computer. But we need to ensure that Git is available inside your console.

I expect that you know what a console is because we will use it through this book very often. Usually, we use a console to execute commands. What commands to execute depends on us. Since we will be working with Git, we will use the commands it provides. Every command is like a button on the interface. Whenever you execute a command, it is something similar to what happens when you click the button on the interface.

Let’s use our first command that shows the version of the installed Git on the computer.

Let’s open a console and write our first Git command

```
git --version
```

It should print

```
git version 2.37.0
```

>NOTE: That printed version in your console will be equal to the version you installed on your computer. In my case, the version that is installed on my computer is 2.37.0.

If you don’t see a similar message in your console, it may mean that Git was not properly installed. Or at least it doesn’t work inside a console. Try to restart the console and execute `git --version` command again. If nothing changes, you need to fix this problem before moving to the next chapters.

I hope your installation experience went smoothly and there were no problems. If so, let’s move forward

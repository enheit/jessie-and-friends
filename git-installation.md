Git installation

To start to work with Git we need to install it on our computer. I leave a reference here from which you can install it. The only requirement is that that version should be equal or larger than 2.37.0.

After installation open your favourite console and write `git â€”version`. If it prints the message with the git version it means that everything is installed correctly. If not please try to start from the beginning.

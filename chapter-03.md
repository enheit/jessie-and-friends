# Chapter 3: Git installation

![The process of installing Git on a computer](./images/chapter-3.jpeg)

As we discussed in the previous chapter, in order to get started with Git, we need to install it on our computer.

Since absolutely any operating system can be installed on your computer (for example, Windows, Linux/Unix, or macOS), and the installation process is different for each operating system, I hope you can handle this task yourself.

This is the link to the official download page where you can get the latest version of Git

https://git-scm.com/downloads

The only thing I can recommend is to always stay with the default installation. Do not change any settings during installation until you know what you are doing.

While you are installing Git, Jessie and I will be waiting for you in the next chapter. Take your time, don’t hurry…

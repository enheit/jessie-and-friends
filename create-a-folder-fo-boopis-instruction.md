Create a folder for Boopiâ€™s instructions


Woof-woof! Good point, Jessie!

To start writing instructions for Boopi, we need to find a place where we would store our files with instructions. It is a good practice to group related files under a folder somewhere on your computer. So let's create it. Jessie and I have no claim in which place the folder should be created. The only advice is that the place should be convenient for you. 

Woof! Woof!

Impressions: 5/5

Note:

---


It's been a long journey where we mainly covered the most basic Git commands. Using those commands, we created toys for two of Jessie's friends and rescued a fallen Thomas with a lifebuoy. We even managed to break the Boopi by accident and fix him back. The `.gitignore` file helped us not to make such mistakes in the future. In addition, we have overcome merge conflicts, which were considered the scariest topic while learning Git. 

 Yes, it was fun!

Here is the list of all commands that we used as a tool for achieving our goals:  
- git init
- git add
- git commit
- git status
- git log
- git branch
- git revert
- git stash
- git merge

with many other optional attributes that can be applied to existing commands and modify their execution:
- git log -1
- git checkout -b red-apple
- git stash --include-untracked

and many more...

It would make no sense to overload the introduction book with other equally useful commands that have remained untouched. So I hope this book will help you start your new journey of learning Git.

So, Jessie and others, it's time to say bye to the reader!

Woof-woof!

Oh, hold on!

It seems like Boopi, what's to give you something.

Bi-boop!
